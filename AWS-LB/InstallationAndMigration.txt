Installation and Migration of Amplio Server
===========================================

This documents how to install the server component of Amplio software, and how to migrate
from one server to another. Installation is the same in either case, the difference
being in preparation work prior to migration.

Installation
============
1) Install and configure a modern Linux server. The specific host and the distro are not
particularly important; the only real variation would be which packages are installed
by default.

2) Install Dropbox, and configure it to run as processing@. You may need to install
python 2.7 for the dropbox.py utility, to check status, etc. Install Dropbox first,
because it will take several DAYS to sync.

3) Install AWS CLI if necessary, and configure a user with appropriate access (config
and credentials files in the ~/.aws directory). config may look like this
	[default]
	region = us-west-2
and credentials should look like this
	[default]
	aws_access_key_id = 
	aws_secret_access_key = 

4) Install and configure psql. On Ubuntu 18.04, this was
	sudo apt install postgresql-client-common
	sudo apt install postgresql-client-10
Run psql --host=lb-device-usage.ccekjtcevhb7.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com --port 5432
			--username=lb_data_uploader --dbname=dashboard
and ensure that the connection works.

5) Create directories
	dashboardreports
	ufreports
Optionally, rsync the contents from the previous server. Not strictly necessary, as 
the contents will be recreated.

6) Install the AWS python libraries, with 'pip3 install boto3'. May need to install pip3 
first.

7) Install JRE. Note that the stats import process does not work with jre 10. Install
openjdk-8.

At this point one can start hand-running the jobs in the cron job set. When they're all
working, start cron with the cron/crontab.txt file.
