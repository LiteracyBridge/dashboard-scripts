Note for testing: to connect to a database other than the production RDS database, edit
dashboard.properties to point to the correct database instance (or provide a test version
of the .properties file). IMPORTANT: you must move or rename any global file, located in
/opt/literacybridge/dashboard.properies; that file takes precedence, if it exists.
